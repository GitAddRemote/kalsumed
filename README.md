# kalsumed
Kalsumed is an application built to track user daily food intake (Kilocalorie Consumed is where the name came from). Eventually, I expect to populate the food via 3rd party API, and to assist the user with some sort of focused AI tooling to lighten the burden of food recognition and portion recognition via photos.
